## 🪟 About the Project

**Windows 12 Experience** is a modern, web-based desktop operating system simulation built using standard web technologies.

The project focuses on recreating and experimenting with the visual design, interaction patterns, and desktop workflows of a next-generation operating system directly inside a web browser. It aims to demonstrate how far HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be pushed to simulate a full desktop-like experience.

This project is intended for **educational, experimental, and demonstration purposes only** and is not designed for commercial use.
